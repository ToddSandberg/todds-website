# November 2023

Below is an overview of the different changes I've been making in various projects.

### ScryPortal
See projects tab for details.
- Added an button to priorization to choose if its ascending or descending

### Domu Peak
This is an old project I've rekindled with a bit. The initial implementation was focused on creating a weather system in the Unity engine that was somewhat
realistic based on the time of day and year.
- move to new unity input system

### Procedural Generation
I've had an interest in procedural generation this month. My first attempt was following Sebastian Lague tutorials in Unity to create a very basic map with perlin noise.
As an experiment, and to help me understand the code better, I then attempted to transfer this procedural generation to Godot.

### 64 Days
Another old project I've rekindled with. This game is my dream RPG to make, and so I've been trying to work on small improvements here and there when I can.
- Added the ability to switch loadouts with a press of a button

### SteamChievos
This is a project to track achievements in various platforms (despite the name).
